* [Lesson 1 - Starting Out](/lesson1_startingOut)


### The repl
* Start with `ghci`.
* Load and _compile_ a source code file into the process' address space - `:l <file_path>`.
* Reload currently linked files - `:r`.
* Display the type of a piece of data - `:t <data>`. `<data>` can also be a function name.

### General Notes
* Two function types:
  - _prefix_ which is like a traditional function name followed by arguments (`fx_name A B C`). The function is prefix to the data.
  - _infix_ which is like an _operator_ such as `A + B`. The function is _inbetween_ the data. With backticks, we can make a binomial function an _infix_ (`div A B` --> `A \`div\` B`).
  - Functions/operators of only special characters (`+`, `*`, `/=` ...) are considered _infix_ by default. To write them as _prefix_ we must surround them in parentheses, `(+) 1 2` gives 3.
  - _polymorphic_ when a function uses a _type variable_ and therefore has a loose declaration.
* Some translations from C:
  - `!=` --> `/=`
  - Functions without arguments --> `#define` and are immutable.
  - array --> list - use when you have an arbitrary amount of a type of data.
  - struct --> tuple - use when you have data representing a specific thing (like a coordinate).
* Datatypes:
  - All hard data types (not variable) have capitalized names.
  - Boolean `True` or `False` (primitive)
  - Int `7` (will adapt to float in cases like `1 + 1.0`), bound to [-2147483648, 2147483648]. (primitive)
  - Integer (has no bound but less efficient) (_primitive_).
  - Num
  - Float `3.14`(primitive)
  - Double (as expected, float with double the precision) (primitive).
  - Fractional
  - Char `'a'` (primitive)
  - List `[1,2,3]` (_primitive_)
  - Tuple `(1,2,'a')` (_primitive_)
  - Ordering `LT`, `GT` or `EQ` (essentially an enum to denote order).
  - String `"abc"` or `['s','b','c']` --> list of character (`[Char]`)
  - type variable (some letter like `'a', 'b', ...`) is like a void pointer, could be anything.
    - e.g. `:t fst` gives `fst :: (a,b) -> a` which means the return value has the same type as the first value.
* Type Classes:
  - These are interfaces that types may implement such that they can be used with functions that have _class constraints_.
  - e.g. `:t (==)` gives `(==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool`.
    - The second part of `a -> a -> Bool` just means the 2 args must have the same type and the return value is a Boolean.
    - The first part of `(Eq a) =>` is a _class constraint_ saying that `a` needs to have the type class for `Eq`.
    - `:t elem` --> `(Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool` since it uses `(==)` to determine if an element is in a list.
    - `Eq` supported types implement `==` and `/=`.
    - `Ord` supported types implement `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `<` (ordering stuff). Requires that `Eq` is already satisfied.
    - `Show` supported types can be printed (output in String form). To print, use `show 3` --> `"3"`.
    - `Read` (accompanied with function `read`) is the opposite of `Show`. `read` is basically `eval` (Ruby). e.g. `read "3" + 2` gives 5.
      - Function `read` is a bit special. `:t read` is `read :: (Read a) => String -> a which means the return value is void.
      - If we don't use it directly with another defined type, it won't know how to interpret the returned value.
      - To solve this, we use a _type annotation_ which declares how we want the output to be interpreted. e.g. `read "3" :: Int` gives 3.
    - `Enum` are sequentially ordered. Can use `succ`, `pred`, etc.
    - `Bounded` are types with bounds. They are polymorphic since they work on many types. `minBound :: Int` --> `-9223372036854775808`, `minBound :: Char` --> `'\NUL'`.
    - `Num` are _number like_ classes. Requires that `Eq` and `Show` already comply.
    - `Integral`, as expected, is whole numbers and contains `Int` and `Integer`.
    - `Floating` includes `Float` and `Double`.
  - `fromIntegral` is a function to turn (cast) an Integral type into a `Num` so that you can use it with `Floating`. While a piece of data, say `5`, might have a strictest definition of something like `Int` it can be treated with broader definitions right up to type classes themselves which are just interfaces (like `Num`).
* Declarations:
  - You can explicitly declare the IO types of a function (the mapping type) before writing out the function (likes headers in C) (see [def.hs](def.hs)).
  - The difference between `Int -> Int -> Int` and `Int, Int -> Int` is ...
* Function syntax:
  - `<function name> arg1 arg2 arg3 = <stuff with args>`
  - Function names must start with a lowercase character because ...
* IF:
  - _IF_ branches must always have an `else` claws. This ensures that the _IF_ block is an _expression_ (code that always returns something).
* Lists:
  - Lists are inherent data structures to the language.
  - They can be of any type but must be homogeneous.
  - Lists of lists can be of different lengths but not different types of lists. Think about casted pointers in C!
  - Concatenation of lists `A` and `B` is defined as `A ++ B` (`O(|A|)`).
  - `cons` operator is a perpend insert of a single character. `1:[2,3,4] --> [1,2,3,4]` (`O(1)`).
  - You can then assume that `[1,2,3]` is equivalent to `1:2:3:[]`.
  - Indexing into a list is with `!!` such that `"abc" !! 1 --> 'b'`.
  - Operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` are defined as working from the head of the list and breaking _on first win_. i.e. `[3,2,1] > [3,2,0] --> True`.
  - `head` returns the first element.
  - `tail` returns everything after the first element (the head).
  - `last` returns the last element.
  - `init` returns everything before the last element.
  - ^ all of these throw exceptions on empty lists. For the functions below, you don't need to check for the length.
  - `length` returns the number (integer) of elements in the list.
  - `null` returns `True` if the list is empty.
  - `reverse` reverses a list.
  - `take <int> <list>` returns the first <int> number elements for <list>.
  - `drop <int> <list>` returns <list> without the first <int> elements.
  - `minimum` returns the min element.
  - `maximum` returns the max element.
  - `sum` returns the sum of all the elements.
  - `product` is the production of all elements.
  - `A \`elem\` B` tells us if `A` is in the list `B`.
  - `[A..B]` returns all sequential elements (if that is defined) from `A` to `B`.
  - `[A,B..C]` returns a linear spacing of `A` to `C` with step size of deduced as `B-A`. Floats in these devices often have funky precision errors.
  - `cycle` returns an infinite repetition of the list (flattened).
  - `repeat <element>` returns an infinite list of the element or is the same as `cycle [<element>]`.
  - `replicate A B` returns a list of length `A` with every element being `B`.
  - We can write _list comprehensions_ or _mappings_ like so `[x*x | x <- [1..5]`  which returns `[1,4,9,16,15]`.
    - Predicates can be added (aka _filtering_). `[x*x | x <- [1..5], even (x*x)]` gives all the even squares.
    - Multiple predicates/filters can be added. `[x*x | x <- [1..10], even (x*x), x*x < 50]` gives `[4,16,36]`.
  - You should see by now that lists are a way to implement _loops_. This is also true when it comes to double loops where supply 2 lists.
    - `[x*y | x <- [1,2,3], y <- [2,2,0]]` gives `[2,2,0,4,4,0,6,6,0]`.
    - A loop is required to compute length, but the element-iterator is not used in the mapping so we denote it as `_`. `length' x = sum[1 | _ <- x]
* Laziness:
  - Haskell will operate on actual data and evaluate expressions only when absolutely necessary.
  - We can define infinite lists like `take 5 [1..]`. `[1..]` never finishes computing but since `take 3` requires only a piece, it will finish and return `[1,2,3]`.
* Tuples:
  - Length and types (at each index) define the type of tuple.
  - They can be inhomogeneous.
  - Denoted by parentheses like `(1,2)` or `('a','b','c')`.
  - There is no _empty_ or _null_ tuple.
  - Comparators are defined.
  - `fst x` returns the first _component_ of tuple `x`.
  - `snd x` returns the second _componet_ of tuple `x`.
  - ^ these only work on _pairs_ (tuples with only two components).
  - `zip A B` will return a list of pairs where the elements of `A` are paired up with the elements of `B`.
* Calculation by filtering:
  - This is common practice in functional programming.
  - How do we calculate all the right triangles with integer sides <= 10 and perimetre = 24.
  - In an imperative language we would probably have to triple loop and check for both right-ness and the length of the perimeter.
  - In Haskell, building from the initial full space to a specific result is a bit more elegant.

```haskell
-- all triangles of integer sides <= 10
[(a,b,c) | a <- [1..10], b <- [1..10], c <- [1..10]]

-- remove the duplicates
[(a,b,c) | a <- [1..10], b <- [1..a], c <- [1..b]]

-- make the triangles right again
[(a,b,c) | c <- [1..10], b <- [1..c], a <- [1..b], a^2 + b^2 == c^2]

-- remove the ones without the target perimeter
[(a,b,c) | c <- [1..10], b <- [1..c], a <- [1..b], a^2 + b^2 == c^2, a+b+c == 24]
```
